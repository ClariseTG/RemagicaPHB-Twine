# Remagica 3.2.X  
Remagica 3.2 might be moving to astro.build, as per the advice of a friend. Harlowe is a wonderful, wonderful tool and I want to use it forever but it does have drawbacks that I need to move past. Thank you Harlowe, and thank you Twine. I'll miss you!  
This is a WIP repo that I'm using to synchronize changes across devices, but feel free to take a look around!  
Please keep in mind that while this is a working copy for the *site,* you shouldn't trust any of the mechanical information here. Everything is subject to change.  
## Remagica 3.1- PHB
