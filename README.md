# Remagica 3.2.X
Remagica v3.2 and onward were meant to be published as a Twine document due to the high load time on the Google Doc for v.3.1 and earlier.\n
This is a WIP written in Harlowe 3.1. The content is far from complete, but most of the code is either complete or vestigial (many abandoned ideas.) I have no idea if I'll come back to this project anytime soon, but I definitely put a lot of effort into it last year.
The most recent major edits to this were in June of 2022.
