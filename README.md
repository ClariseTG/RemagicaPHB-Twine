# Remagica 3.2.X  
This is the old PHB for Remagica 3.2! It's in Harlowe, but there's a newer one around somewhere.
This is a WIP repo that I'm using to synchronize changes across devices, but feel free to take a look around!  
Please keep in mind that while this is a working copy for the *site,* you shouldn't trust any of the mechanical information here. Everything is subject to change.  
## Remagica 3.1- PHB
Looking for the legacy version used in the Theodora Campaign? Look no further!
